# Data_Cleaning_Project 
According to the data analysis course at my university (BAU), we were asked to work on a diabetes dataset project which had many issues that I solved using different libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. I am really proud of what I achieve until now and looking forward to the future to improve my skills.
